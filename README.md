# Power Grid Robots Automation project
This project aims to automate the Robots expansion for Power Grid, to assist players with using that expansion in their own games of Power Grid.

This is my first project, so it is very much a learning experience - all comments welcome. 
(I am sure I am making mistakes in terminology in the description)

My next task is to work on how the robot will choose what resources to buy, based on what power plants they have available and the costs of the different resources in the market. I also need to decide how the information about those resources will be stored in the robot player.

The end goal is to put this into a website that human players can access, which will ask the human players for information about the game state and then tell the human players what actions to take for the robot player(s).
