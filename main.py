# This programme is going to enable someone to input the details from a Power Grid map
# and then that information will be used by a 'robot' programme that will play Power Grid
# with the person.

# I need to create a class 'map', I think, and inside that create a dictionary that has the cities,
# and then a dictionary that has the links between the cities. I also need a dictionary of the regions
# and which cities are in the different regions
#
# There will also need to be a resource
# market - but I'll do that later on.

class Map:
    # this is the class for the maps
